It’s a lot to navigate, and where I live there aren’t many people or roles in this space or people with experience. I graduate in a few months and want to start a career in this field but i dont know how to go about it. i have been working on konkani LLM to train llm to understand indian languages and i had also shown interest in redesigning hugging chat which is dead now.

As I work on datasets most of the time, I have a couple questions related to it. While I think they have been answered before, I think bringing it up should spark constructive discussion:

1. What is HF's definitive policy on datasets containing scraped web content, particularly distinguishing between publicly accessible data *(e.g. bluesky firehose, publicly accessible scraped X posts, CommonCrawl)* and paywalled material? *(e.g. Articles on news sites behind a paywall content)*
2. HF is increasingly being used as a free-for-all CDN *(e.g. people using it for file hosting)*, which degrades user experience and discoverability of new and novel datasets. Does HF have any future plans to remedy this issue?
3. The current ambiguity around NSFAA *(Not Safe For All Audiences / NSFW / Not Safe For Work)* content creates confusion for creators and users. What is the strategic reason for not having a clear, public-facing policy on this, and can the community expect a definitive stance that clarifies what is and isn't permissible on the Hub?
4. AI Waifus? Yay or Nay? ~~Also free gpus?~~

However i think Ai today isn't ready to run on CPUs efficently and uses alot of GPU computations even tho again you get a model trying to solve the problem at the end at % accuracy so that 8 hours of trial and error + 16 hours of training on consumer GPUs are insane

So sometimes i see it as a bubble like the .com bubble which is worrysome to me 

From your experience how do you see my points ? 

And how can I hopefully get a job in this career when i graduate ?

Parallel to this, there seems to be a very vocal minority? majority?? on social media really really pissed about *any* content, even public social media posts being used to train any kind of model, regardless if it's done to advance open source AI research. Do you think there is any viable way of switching this public opinion, and educating the general public about work done by ""the good guys"" such as HF?

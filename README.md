## TL;DR (high‑level but thorough)

**Clem (Clement Delangue, CEO & co‑founder of Hugging Face) hosted a fast‑paced AMA on the HF Discord.** The community asked about **career pathways**, **product direction**, **policy & ethics**, **infrastructure & costs**, **business strategy**, and **culture**. Clem’s answers were short, upbeat, and always pointed to an existing Hugging Face resource (Learn portal, tasks page, open‑source libraries) and a call to **build a public HF profile**.

### 1️⃣ Career, hiring & community building  

| **Question (who asked)** | **Clem’s short reply / action** |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| *New‑grad / self‑learner – where to focus?* (reubencf) | “Create an HF profile, publish open‑source work (datasets, Spaces, tokenizers).  Link your profile (e.g., https://huggingface.co/Reubencf).” |
| *What does it take to become an AI Engineer?* (graham8367) | “Self‑learners can be hired.  Focus on embeddings, world‑models, robotics.  Show work on your HF profile – it shows up in hiring.” |
| *Intermediate‑level AI‑person wants a HF job in 2 y* (hasanfaesal) | “Contribute openly, master embeddings, explore world‑model research; add everything to a public HF profile.” |
| *Best path for fresh‑grad AI engineers?* (siddhantparadox) | “Focus on multimodal AI (robotics, biology, chemistry, world‑models).  Less hallucination, more safety.” |
| *How to get hired / intern at HF?* (several) | **Apply** via https://apply.workable.com/huggingface/.  **Remote‑first** – offices NY, Paris, SF, Miami. |
| *What makes a candidate stand out?* (aceflex) | “Show an open‑source project with real impact, a strong HF profile, and clear contribution metrics.” |
| *How to become “AI‑builder” vs “software builder”?* (Clem) | “We aim for 10 M AI builders, 10× growth.  Open‑source contributions are the fastest route.” |
| *How to get GPU/compute grants?* (lunarflu) | “Apply via the “GPU” button in the HF UI or ping Clem.  Community GPU grants exist.” |
| *Ambassador / Fellows program* (aileenvl, jungnerd) | **Ambassador** merged with **Fellows**; apply through the Workable page. |
| *Where to start learning?* (saucegardner2024) | **Start at** https://huggingface.co/tasks and https://huggingface.co/learn. |
| *Good‑First‑Issue list?* (senzen69) | **GitHub “Good First Issue”** list (link posted). |
| *How to get HF swag?* (santo6, katina_c) | “Contribute, then ask (Clem jokes about “harassing” staff).  Swag is given to contributors / event attendees.” |
| *Community Discord channels* (Clem, final message 9:58 PM) | `#introduce-yourself`, `#ask-for-help`, `🤖robotics🤖`, `#today-im-learning`, `_i-made-this`. |
